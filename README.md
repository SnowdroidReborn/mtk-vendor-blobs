# Vendor proprietary binaries for MediaTek-based devices

This repository contains all the necessary MediaTek libraries, distributed exclusively as binaries, found in Stock or Patch ROMs.

## Disclaimer
We do not ship any proprietary software source code licensed by MediaTek and/or device manufacturers, as this repository is only a helper component for building AOSP.

For full support of MTK devices, please contact only authorized MediaTek sources.
